Instruction on how to run program: Ensure Node.js is installed, in order to check that it is installed, you can run node -v
in any terminal to see if and what version of Node you have downloaded. This app was created using vite. In order to create a vite app, I ran "npm create vite@latest" in the terminal to create the app and then proceeded to select React as a framework then Typescript as the language. 

Setting up the backend environment, I just installed "npm i body-parser, cors, express and fs"

In order to start the backend you type npm start and it will run on localhost:3000

For the front-end I ran "npm i" to download all the files needed and then "npm run dev" to create the server and start running the code

I'm pretty happy with the code I wrote. I came into this project on this previous Tuesday with minimal experience in React, no experience setting up or running a backend, no experience in Typescript and barely any project building experience and threw something together in a few days that I think works well, has some interesting features and shows me that I can create cool stuff.

I would've started earlier but I was soo busy. I wish I had more time to maybe make it look better or to make sure that the number of questions logic wasn't messed up. Unfortunately, I can't do more tomorrow because I need to catch up on schoolwork since I've basically done nothing of the sort the last 3 days. So I'm submitting this and hoping for the best. The issue is when the question hit 0, the game doesn't go to the statistics page right away but rather you need to hit guess one more time before it does so.

Also, Ekreb is Berke backwards. Soooo...
